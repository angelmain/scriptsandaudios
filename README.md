Script and Audio List Template

Insert your data on the table by modifying the index.html (for the audios) and indexscripts.html (for the scrpits) files using any code editor. There are more instructions on how to fill them in the comments of the code. The link between the two is made automatically, so don't worry about that.

You can then host it at any place that lets you host simple pages. I recommend GitHub Pages since it's free and very easy to set up. After you create your GitHub Page, you can just clone this repository there and insert your data.

If you only do script offers, you can find a list template just for those here: https://github.com/angelmain/scriptlist

If you only do audios, you can find a list template just for those here: https://github.com/angelmain/audiolist
